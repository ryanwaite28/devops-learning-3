# Best Practices

For the lab, the goal is to showcase best practices for industry leading DevSecOps. This includes:
* GitOps - changes to infrastructure should be captured via git, as much as possible.
* Shift-Left - fail as fast as possible to prevent production issues as much as possible
* Observability - components should provide metrics/vitals on their running conditions
