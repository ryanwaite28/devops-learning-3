🚀 PHASE 0 — Foundation & Discipline (Start Here)

Before touching Kubernetes or Jenkins, we establish professional hygiene.

✅ Current Task: Repository Initialization & Project Discipline
🎯 Objective

Create a clean, enterprise-grade repository structure and documentation baseline.

🧠 Background (Why This Is Important)

In real platform teams:

Repos live for years

Many engineers contribute

Documentation is a first-class artifact

If your repo looks sloppy, no one trusts the platform.

This step proves you understand:

Infrastructure as Code discipline

Documentation-driven engineering

Reproducibility

📘 Concepts & Takeaways

You should understand:

Why repo structure matters at scale

Why docs come before implementation

Separation of concerns (platform vs app vs pipelines)

Treating infrastructure as a product

🛠️ Implementation Instructions
1️⃣ Create the Repository

Create a GitHub repo named something like:

kube-platform-engineering-lab

Clone it locally.

2️⃣ Create Base Directory Structure

Create empty directories only (no YAML yet):

.
├── README.md
├── docs/
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── threat-model.md
│   ├── decisions.md
│   └── diagrams/
├── docker-compose/
│   ├── gitlab/
│   ├── jenkins/
│   ├── infisical/
│   └── observability/
├── kubernetes/
│   ├── clusters/
│   │   └── kind/
│   ├── namespaces/
│   ├── jenkins/
│   │   ├── controller/
│   │   └── agent-templates/
│   ├── app/
│   ├── security/
│   └── observability/
├── helm/
│   ├── app-chart/
│   └── platform-charts/
├── app/
│   ├── api/
│   └── Dockerfile
├── pipelines/
│   ├── Jenkinsfile
│   └── shared-libs/
└── scripts/
3️⃣ Populate Initial Documentation
README.md

Copy the README we created earlier as-is

Do not modify yet

docs/architecture.md

Add:

One paragraph describing the platform’s purpose

A placeholder header: ## Architecture Diagram

docs/threat-model.md

Add:

Header: ## Threat Model

Bullet list with at least 3 threat categories:

Supply chain

Credential leakage

Lateral movement

docs/decisions.md

Add:

Header: ## Architecture Decisions

One decision:

“Why Kubernetes is used as the CI execution substrate”

4️⃣ Git Discipline

Initialize git

Commit with message:

chore: initialize platform repository structure and docs

Push to GitHub.

✅ Acceptance Criteria (You Are “Done” When…)

Repo structure matches exactly

README is present and professional

Docs exist (even if minimal)

Single clean commit

No implementation yet

This mirrors how real platform teams start.

⚠️ Common Pitfalls (Avoid These)

❌ Writing YAML before design

❌ Mixing app and platform concerns

❌ Skipping docs “until later”

❌ Overengineering at this stage

📌 What Comes Next (Don’t Do Yet)

Next task will be:

Phase 1 — Docker Compose platform bootstrap (GitLab, Jenkins, Infisical)

This is where you’ll learn:

Container networking

Service dependencies

Persistent volumes

How CI platforms are actually hosted

🔁 Your Move

Complete Phase 0 and reply with:

Confirmation it’s done

Link to the repo (or describe structure if private)

Then I’ll unlock Phase 1: Docker Compose as Platform Substrate.

You’re building this the right way.
